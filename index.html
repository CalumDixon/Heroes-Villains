<p class="article-para first-para drop-capped">On the outskirts of London in Eton, local farmer Duncan Brindley has formed a peculiar rivalry with an avian foe. A local swan from a pond nearby to his farm has decided to claim one of Brindley’s plots of land as his own. Despite his best efforts Brindley has not managed to make the swan abandon the plot of land, his efforts to chase the bird away have only resulted in its return shortly after his absence. Any effort to stop the bird from returning also seem to have failed, each time the bird has managed to maneuver each obstacle, with the issue escalating to the point of the plot of land featuring a barbed wire fence, a small ditch moat surrounding the plot, and animal traps hidden throughout the plot.</p>

<p class="article-para indent-para">  As of today the local authorities have become involved in the matter after concerns were raised by local citizens regarding the swan potentially causing a smaller harvest due to crop damage. Constable Danny Butterman & Sergeant Nicholas Angel have been tasked with removing the bird from the property.

<p class="article-para first-para drop-capped">For the 4 decades, the fisheries of Norway and the British Isles have been locked in fierce competition over fishing territories within the Norwegian Sea. Scotsman Markus Boyd was one of many affected, having left for sea in unfavourable conditions due to falling behind on catch targets, Boyd was blown off course and destroyed his ship against the cliff sides of the Norwegian coast. Boyd like most fisherman wasn't taking money with him on his trips, so was forced to stay in Norway for some time due to lacking the necessary funds to pay for a ferry home. During his stay Boyd struggled to find work as a result of the language barrier, resulting in him having to slowly hitchhike from Norway to France where he managed to find English speaking fisherman willing to take him across the English channel.</p>

Miss Lacksnatch has reportedly stated that she discovered this fact when making an unannounced visit to the Pastor to surprise him with a Christmas gift. Yesterday morning, Judge David Livingstone charged Pastor Hastings of both misappropriation of funds and theft, with a sentence of 4 months in prison.</p>

Although Judge Livingstone’s claims have been widely disregarded by the local communities as this is not the first time that such accusations have been made against Judge Livingstone. </p>

  <p class="article-para first-para drop-capped">In the small village of Dogmersfield, an uproar has been started by locals after accusations were made from Lara Grant against local bakery owner Sara Anderson accusing her of performing black magic and poisoning the people of the town. Grant bases her claims on allegedly being an eyewitness to Anderson speaking to her pet black cat whom she believes to be Anderson’s familiar. </p>
  <h4 class="dinkus">*<span class="dinkus-space"></span>*<span class="dinkus-space"></span>*</h4>
  <p class="article-para indent-para last-para">Most locals ignored Grant’s calls to action against Anderson, dismissing them as absurd and ridiculous, although there is a small minority who have joined Grant in her protest. This has resulted in local authorities having to become involved in the matter after Anderson had reported that Grant and others had been watching her house at night and vandalised her property with posters telling her to leave the village. When local authorities confronted Grant regarding these claims she agreed that Anderson’s account was true but then went on to defend her actions as an act of neighbourhood protection. Shortly afterward Grant was charged with for acts of disturbing the peace and harassment, resulting in 3 months in prison.</p>
